# Local development and deployment gates

## Windows local run

1. Install Ollama and ensure `gpt-oss:120b-cloud` is listed. Local GPU and CPU inference are prohibited.
2. Run `ollama signin`; both extraction and optional dialogue use the Ollama cloud service.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`; do not add patient data or provider API keys.
4. Run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
5. Run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:registries`, `npm run verify:http`, and `npm run audit:clean-room`.

In `npm run dev`, a clearly marked shortcut bar can open the note, masking, summary-confirmation, or trial-card stages with synthetic fixture data. It exists only for interface development; the reducer rejects stage-jump events outside `NODE_ENV=development`, and the fixture must never contain patient data.

## Public deployment is intentionally gated

The server-side localhost proxy reaches the server machine, not a visitor's computer, and it does not make cloud inference local. Public deployment requires a reviewed proxy architecture, provider data-processing terms, explicit consent records, and a Taiwan privacy-law review.

Before release, resolve every item in `READINESS.md`, host TFDA snapshots outside request-time decompression, configure rate limits and monitoring without medical payloads, obtain the exact WebMCP origin-trial token, and complete Chrome Inspector plus accessibility/browser acceptance.

No deployment may enable automated outreach, enrollment, booking, consent, or treatment recommendations.
